## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

A1.Python is called general purpose and high level programming langauge because 
    1-its easy to code and understand.
    2-low level languages are more closer to machine codes(0,1,binary codes) while high level languages are more closer to general human communication language[English in this case].
    3-Codes are easily readable to others so its a general purpose language
    4-It is portable means it can run on any system including Windows,Mac,Linux.
    5-Supports Development in Aritifical Intelligence.
    6-Codes Written in General English are converted to Machine Language[Binary Codes] 
      using Interpretter and Complier hence no need of processor.
    7-Because of the above stated reason Python is a general and High Level Language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
A2. Python is called Dynamically typed langauage because we dont have to define type of variable while assigning any variable.
it takes care of the type of variable.
example:
in other langauges when have to define type as 
var a=10:
var b=20 
but in python we can simply define variables as 
a=10
b=20 etc

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
A3.Pros
1-Easy to understand and code
2-Dynamic type language
3-it have many libraries like pandas which can be used in data analysis
4-its higly scalable/Instagram,facebook and pinterest are use the power of python
5-Extensively used in Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,future technologies like Internet of things[IOT] etc
6-its portable means it can run on any system[WORA-Write Once and Run Anywhere]
Cons 
1-it is slow compared to other non-complied langauges and requires lot of computational power
2-comes with high memory usages and high memory consumption
3-its uses reference counting and garbage collection
4-Multithreading in python

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
A4.Domains where Python can be used:
1-Data analysis and Data Science
Data Collection and Cleaning 
Data Exploration
Data Modelling 
Data Visualization 
2-Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
3-Deep Learning Frameworks like Caffe,Tensorflow,PyTorch,Keras
2-Automations 
3-Web Scraping
Scrapy and Beautiful Soup 
4-Distributed Processing 
PySpark
Dask 
5-Finance
Fraud Detection
risk analytics
credit scoring 
6-Big Data 
7-Data Engineering 
8-Job Scheduling with Airflow 
9-Natural Language Processing 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
A5.Variable in python are memory locations to store values.
a variable in python program gives data to the computer for processing.
how to declare a variable:
a variable in python can be declared by any name or even alphabet like a,aa,abc etc can be used 
example:
lets understand the concept of datatypes in variables now:
data types can be integer,strings,arrays,float,dictionary,list,typles 
name="Bhawesh" 
here we have declared a variable called name and assigned value "Bhawesh" to it.
Note:name variable is of string data types and enclosed in double quotes.
now lets declare a int variable:
number=10
n=10 
in the above example we have declared a interger variable called number and assigned 10 to it 
alternatively we can assign the same value to the variable n 
Note:
variable defining can sometimes be very tricky for developers and it has to be of some sense so that it can be easily understood by other programmers 

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
A6.we can take input from user in python by defining input()
Example 1:
name=input("Enter Your Name: ")
age = input("Enter Your Age: ")
print("Hi "+name+" Your age is:"+str(age))

Example 2:
number1=input("Please enter no.1-")
number2=input("Please enter no.2-")
print ("the sum of two numbers are",(int(number1)+int(number2)))

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
A7.string

Q8. What is type casting?
A8.Type casting refers to the conversion of the datatype 
lets consider these functions 
int() refers to the interger conversion
float() refers to the float conversions
str() refers to the string or text conversion
Lets consider below examples:
a=10
b=10.2
c="1"

# lets define the below variables:

a=10
b=10.1
c="1"

print ("the type of a is",type(a))
print ("the type of b is",type(b))
print ("the type of c is",type(c))

# lets add variable b and c:
# d=b+c
# print ("the sum of b and c is:",d)
# here it will give error because we are trying to add b which is float and c which is string 
# to tackle ths we need to convert c which is looking like integer to integer 
# so 

d=b+int(c)
print ("the sum of b and c is: ",d)
Important:
Here it was possible to add b and c because we have converted c which was string type to interger type 
this was the case of typecasting
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
A9.Yes we can take more than one input from the user using single input() function 
Example:
Taking two inputs at a time 
x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print("Number of teachers in class: ", x)
print("Number of students in the class: ", y)
print ()
Taking three inputs at a time
x,y,z=input("Enter three values:").split()
print ("Number of teachers in class: ",x)
print ("Number of girls in the class :",y)
print ("Number of boys in the class :",z)

Q10. What are keywords?
A10.Keywords are special words reserved in python 
we cannot use them in variables 
As of now in latest version of python 3.8 there are 38 keywords
Let us list few of the keywords 
1-True 
2-False 
3-else 
4-Break,in ,is,lambdaa,global,conditional statements etc 
Basically all that are used in programming langauges given by python itself are called keywords 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
A11.No Keywords cannot be used as variable 
Example:
Suppose we define a keyword called if as variable:
if="bhawesh"
print(if)
it will throw error saying invalid syntax 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
A12.Python used indentation to identify a block of code 
in other langauge indentation is for readibility purpose only 
lets us look this with an example:
in java script we use curlibraces {} instead on identation 
Example:
if(a==10){

  logger.log("a is equal to 10)
}

else{

  logger.log("a is not equal to 10)

}

Now the same above code is used in python by way of indentation 
if a==10:
  print ("a is equal to 10")
else:
  print ("a is not equal to 10")


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
A13.Using Print() function 
Example:
a=10 
b=20
d=a+b
print ("the sum of a and b is",d)
output will be:
the sum of a and b is 30 

Q14. What are operators in Python?
A14.Operators in Python:
Operators in python are used to perform operation in variables and values 
Example:print (10+5)
There are different types of operators in python
1-Airthmetic Operators
2-Assignment Operators 
3-Comparison Operatiors 
4-Logical Operators 
5-Identiry Operators 
6-Membership Operators 
7-Bitwise Operators

1-Addition Operators 
+ Addition 2+3=5
- Subtraction 3-2=1
* Multiplication 3*2=6
/ Division 3/2 =1
% Modulus 3%2=1
** Exponentiation 3**2=9 
// Floor Division 5//3=2

2-Assignment Operators 
=
x=2
+=
x=x+2 or x+=2 
-=
x=x-2 or x-=2
*=
x=x*3 or x*=3
/=
x=x/3 or x/=3
%=
x=x%3 or x%=3
//=
x=x//3 or x//=3
**=
x=x**3 or x**=3
3-Python Comparison Operators 
==
!=
>
<
>=

the result will be boolean in Comparsion Operations (boolean means Either true or false)
Example:
3==3 
will give true 
4<3
will give false

4-Python Logical Operators 
and Return true if both statment are true 
or Returen true if one of the statment is true 
not Reverse the result ,returns false if the result is true 
5-Python Identity Operators 
is Returns True if both the variables are same object 
Example x is y 
is not Returns True if both variables are not the same object 
Example x is not y 
6-Python Membership Operators 
in Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
7-Python Bit Wise Operators 
these are used to compare binary numbers 
& (AND) Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 
| (OR) Sets ech bit to 1 if one of the two bits is 1

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A15.Both are arithemetic operators 
/ Means Division 
// Means floor division which gives only interger part of division not the decimal part 
Example:

print (3/2)
Result:1.5
print (5//3)
Result:1
