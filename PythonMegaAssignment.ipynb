    "Q1.Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "A1.Python is called general purpose and high level programming langauge because \n",
    "    1-its easy to code and understand.\n",
    "    2-low level languages are more closer to machine codes(0,1,binary codes) while high level languages are more closer to general human communication language[English in this case].\n",
    "    3-Codes are easily readable to others so its a general purpose language\n",
    "    4-It is portable means it can run on any system including Windows,Mac,Linux.\n",
    "    5-Supports Development in Aritifical Intelligence.\n",
    "    6-Codes Written in General English are converted to Machine Language[Binary Codes] \n",
    "      using Interpretter and Complier hence no need of processor.\n",
    "    7-Because of the above stated reason Python is a general and High Level Language."
